### What is Qix?

> Qix is a retro puzzle game developed in 1981 and ported to the Atari 5200 the following year.

---

### What are the rules?

> At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix, a stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. The objective is to draw lines that close off parts of the rectangle to fill in a set amount of the playfield.
